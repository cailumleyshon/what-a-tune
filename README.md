MVP : User answers two questions and web app returns song recommendation.

User Story:
As a user, I would like to be recommended a song based on my current mood and prefered genre.

As a user, I would like to be able to view the previously recommended song.

As a user, I would like to be engaged with the user input methods, so that I return to the site.

Stretch Goal:
