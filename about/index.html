        <h1>Welcome to What a Tune</h1>
        <p class="subheading">Discover the world of music</p>
        <p>
          Our passion for music couldn't have come at a more opportune time. It was during our
          decision to enroll in a Full Stack MERN (Tech Educators) bootcamp that this shared love
          for music blossomed into an exciting idea. Through the course, we met a group of
          like-minded individuals, and the four of us decided to combine our skills and creativity
          to create a music app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bootcamp not only armed us with the technical expertise required for app development
          but also fostered a collaborative spirit. Our diverse backgrounds and shared enthusiasm
          for both music and technology ignited a unique synergy, propelling our project forward. As
          a team, we are proud to represent the potential that lies at the intersection of
          technology and music.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our music app project is not just a testament to our collective creativity and
          determination but also an embodiment of the American spirit of innovation and
          entrepreneurship. We look forward to sharing our harmonious creation with the world,
          illustrating the power of teamwork and passion to turn an idea into a tangible product.

              Lee mainly focused on JavaScript during the development of the web app. One feature he
              is particularly proud of is the functionality to render a random matching song without
              repeated suggestions.

            <p>
              During this project Sam mostly worked on the song recommendation page, including
              styling, animation and a little of the functionality. He was pleased with how the
              animated vinyl record turned out.
